## Biography
I obtained the Ph.D. with the National Engineering Laboratory for Robot Visual Perception and Control Technology at Hunan University, directed by Prof. [Hongshan Yu](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1289/4535.htm) . 

Prior to beginning the Ph.D program, I obtained my B.S. degree with a Top 5% GPA in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Hunan Normal University in 2015. Subsequently, I was recommended for admission to be a postgraduate at Hunan Univerisity without exams. From 2019 to 2020, I was a Visiting Scholar in the Robotic and Vision Group, Department of Computing Science at University of Alberta (Canada), under the supervision of Prof. [Hong Zhang](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zhang/) (IEEE and CAE Fellow).

## Research Interests
My research interests focus on visual SLAM and computer vision.
